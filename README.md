# StateOfOpenCon :: Building Developer Experiences for the Cloud (on top of K8s)


This repo contains a step by step tutorial that enable platform teams to define Development Environments. 

Using GitPod developers can connect to these environments without installing anything in their laptops. By using Knative Functions and Dapr developers can focus on building business value (coding features and fixing bugs) instead of worrying about where the database is or how to connect to it.
